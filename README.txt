This repository is built to reproduce the results presented in "Balancing detection probability and survey effort in multi-state occupancy models: A camera trap simulation analysis" by Osinga et al., 2025.

### File Structure:
# BugsModelCode: 
Contains text files with the occupancy models written in BUGS language. You don’t need to open this folder to run the simulations, as it is referenced within the R code.

# Outputs:
Holds the outputs generated by running the simulations (via the R-code folder) or for creating figures (e.g., SE or CI). This folder is currently empty.

#PosteriorEstimates: 
Contains summary statistics for all model outcomes, organized to mirror the figure structure in the article. The NsiteScenarios folder contains models for different site counts (60, 120, and 240, 500, 1000), including a covariate. The NsurveyScenarios folder contains models for varying survey periods (7,14,35, 70, 140, and 280). The models for 7, 14 surveys and 500, 1000 sites are found in RevisionModels.

# R-code:
## Required packages and versions is always at the top of the script.  All paths are relative to the main Repository folder. 
Contains three folders:
-Figures: Code for recreating the article’s figures, fully functional and dependent on files in the Figures and PosteriorEstimates folders.This code can also be adjusted to create CI/SD plots or look at N.eff and Rhat values for different parameters than highlighted in the paper. 
	-ProcessFiles, CleanList and Diagnostics are functions, these should not be altered or ran, only sourced through ManuscriptFigures.r script.

- Functions: Function code for the simulations - this folder should not be touched. These are simply sourced through scripts in Running models. 
- Running models: Code for running simulations of both basic and multi-state models, configured with identical seeds to replicate results as presented in the paper. "RunningMultistate" and "RunningBasic" are the files that should be engaged with to run simulations - "Simulation function" are functions called on by the Running files. 
	- Rslurm: This is the code we used to run our revision models through a HPC (slurm).
