This repository is built to reproduce the results presented in "Balancing detection probability and survey effort in multi-state occupancy models: A camera trap simulation analysis" by Osinga et al., 2024.

### File Structure:
# BugsModelCode: 
Contains text files with the occupancy models written in BUGS language. You don’t need to open this folder to run the simulations, as it is referenced within the R code.

# Outputs:
Holds the outputs generated by running the simulations (via the R-code folder) or for creating figures (e.g., SE or CI). This folder is currently empty.

#PosteriorEstimates: 
Contains summary statistics for all model outcomes, organized to mirror the figure structure in the article. The NsiteScenarios folder contains models for different site counts (60, 120, and 240), including a covariate. The NsurveyScenarios folder contains models for varying survey periods (35, 70, 140, and 280).

# R-code:

Contains two main folders:
-Figures: Code for recreating the article’s figures, fully functional and dependent on files in the Figures and PosteriorEstimates folders.
-SimulationCode: Code for running simulations of both basic and multi-state models, configured with identical seeds to replicate results as presented in the paper.
